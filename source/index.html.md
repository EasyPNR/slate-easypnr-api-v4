# Introduction

> API Endpoint Version 3

```
http://api.easypnr.com/v3/
```

Welcome to the **EasyPNR API** documentation! Following the further instructions you will be able to decode Amadeus, Sabre and Galileo PNRs directly on your application.

The **EasyPNR API** is a REST Server available at the endpoint [http://api.easypnr.com/v3](http://api.easypnr.com/v3/).

The API is pretty simple, anyway, in case of problems, contact us on [support@easypnr.com](mailto:support@easypnr.com) or using the form available on the [website](http://www.easypnr.com/contact).

## What's new in Version 3?

The authentication now is done using an user API key. Also, the Response of /decode method, the *decoded PNR* can contains information about the seats.

## Older versions

The Protocol Version 2 documentation can be fond here  [http://docs.easypnr.com/api/v2](http://docs.easypnr.com/api/v2/).

# Authentication

> To use the Web Services, you must pass your API Token on all requests:

```curl
# Example of a request using an API Key
curl -i -X POST -h "X-Api-Key: mySecretKey" https://api.easypnr.com/v3/ping
```

To use the Web Services, you must have an active account on the [www.easypnr.com](http://www.easypnr.com) and obtain your **API Key** on the account page. You can manage your API keys in the main website.

Once you have your API Key, you must use it in all Web Service calls, passing your key in an *HTTP Header* named **"X-Api-Key"**.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secret! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
